  <h1>Biryani</h1>
  <img src="../images/Biryani.jpg" alt="Cooked Biryani" width="250" height="200">
  <p>Biryani is a <em>richly aromatic</em> and flavorful <strong>South Asian rice dish</strong> made by layering 
    fragrant basmati rice with marinated meat—commonly chicken, beef, mutton, or fish—and a blend of spices such as cardamom, cloves, 
    cinnamon, and cumin. The dish often includes yogurt, fried onions, 
    fresh herbs like cilantro and mint, and sometimes boiled eggs or potatoes,
     depending on the regional style. It is typically slow-cooked through a method called dum,
      where the pot is sealed and gently steamed, allowing the flavors to meld deeply into every grain of rice.

    <p>Originating from the Indian subcontinent, biryani has many regional variations—Hyderabadi, Lucknowi,
     Sindhi, and Karachi-style, to name a few—each with its own unique spices and cooking techniques.
      Though often associated with celebrations and feasts, biryani holds a special place in everyday cuisine as well.
      It’s more than just food; it’s a cultural experience that reflects centuries of history, trade, and culinary fusion across the Muslim world and South Asia.</p>
