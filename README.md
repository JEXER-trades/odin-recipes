# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course.

Itâ€™s a simple website built using only **HTML** that contains a few of my favorite recipes.

## Features

- Basic HTML structure
- Multiple pages for each recipe
- Links between pages

## What I Learned

- Creating and linking HTML files
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images
- Writing semantic HTML

## Preview

Click on the `index.html` file and open it in your browser to view the site.

## Credits

Built by me while learning web development through The Odin Project ðŸ’»
